# html--to-pdf-automation
Worked on a script to automate html to pdf conversion

How it works is the script find all files in the directory where it is located and its children directories. Then makes uses of the google-chrome executable to do the conversion. Some of the behaviour in the script are niche to me, for example i removed the first appearance of 'dark' in the html file. This represents the background color in my html file and may not be the case for anyone else. I also had a section in this script where i took out the nav bar in the html code which is also a niche need for me.

This is a custom script that was designed for my specific need of automating the conversion of hundreds of html files to pdf. And may not be suited for the needs of others without tweaking the script.
